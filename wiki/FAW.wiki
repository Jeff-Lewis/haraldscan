1. Why the name Harald Scan?
A. Harald Bluetooth Gormson of Denmark was a king and is the reason bluetooth is named bluetooth hence the name Harald

2. Why Python?
A. Simple and easy to do Bluetooth work thanks to Pybluez. It's fast enough to run on my embedded ARM beagleboard, and I like to work with it (Even though I am not a very good Python developer)

3. I get `BluetoothError: error accessing bluetooth` device when I try and run Harald Scan.
A. You need to make sure your bluetooth device is installed and is working properly a good thing to try is `hciconfig hci0 up` If that fails you have more serious issues and should get your bluetooth adapter working first.
