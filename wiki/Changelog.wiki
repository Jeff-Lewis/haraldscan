=0.4=

==Distribution==
  * Harald Scan is now distributed in either source code or dist

==Added Features==
  * CLI has added a Number of devices discovered by duration (default is 15 mins)
  * The duration for above is configurable through `-t TIME`
  * You can choose either a in memory database or a file database
  * Option to disable services scans entirely even if MAC is 'Unknown'
  * Option to disable writing devices to a text file
  * ability to check Harald Scan version with `--version`
  * Added `-f` for flushing a large database to another db file. Typical usage would be with a large in memory database.

==Changed Features==
  * Harald Scan will write to a file every time unless `--no-write` is specified
  * Changed argument handling to optparse much better now
  * Uses sqlite3 module instead of pysqlite2 (I didn't realize it was there :S)

==Bug Fixes==
  * A bunch don't remember though
