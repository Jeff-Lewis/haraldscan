Special Notes
=============
The goal of this project is really to gain as many MAC address mapped to device vendors as possible
If you see an entry on the CLI stating that the Vendor is 'Unknown". Harald Scan probably created a file in the
same directory with the first 6 characters from the MAC address with all the information it could gain from the
device. This will allow me to add it to the MACLIST if I am able to determine who the Vendor is. Eventually this
may be an automatic function but right now I request you email me these files @  tstenvold@gmail.com
